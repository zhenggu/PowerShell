# Docker

Docker file to build the Docker images for PowerShell Core have been moved to [PowerShell/PowerShell-Docker](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-Docker)

## Community

The docker files in the `community` folder were contributed by the community and are not yet officially supported.

We plan to move these to [PowerShell/PowerShell-Docker](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-Docker) once we have a separate channel for publishing community supported images.
